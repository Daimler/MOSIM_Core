# thrift

This project contains the thrift files shared across all WPs in MOSIM. 

The latest Thrift description files are inside the master branch and can be included using git-submodules. The source code files have to be generated in each project separately.

In the WP2 call 31.7. it was decided that Thrift version 0.12.0 should be used for MOSIM. DFKI stressed that this version needs Java 1.8. For other languages no restrictions are known, yet. The source code is provided here for ease of use and as a reference, i.e. developed components need to be compatible with the code stored here.
