# Python

Repository containing the Adapter, MMI and MMU implementation for python

All packages are written for Python 3.
In all folders there is a install.cmd, which installs the python package. 
For this pip and wheels are needed.

I decided to add and create an installer for the thrift 0.12.0 libary because over pip only 0.11.0 is available at the moment.
